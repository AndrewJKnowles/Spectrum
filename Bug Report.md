Bug Report
==========

1. Hardware fault
It would appear that the function drawWaveform() causes a hardware related error:
  Error Status: 0x80FF013D Code: 317 Module: 255
  Error Message: Fault exception
  Location: 0x8015E7C
  Error Value: 0x10000188
This may possibly be due to array sizes and iteration conditions however, exact cause is unknown.

2. arm_rfft_fast_f32 output confirmation
Line 99, "frequencies[frequencyPoint] = (int)(20*log10f(complexABS(FFT_outputBuffer[i], FFT_outputBuffer[i+1])))-offset;" (where offset = 150)
appears to return values of -150, suggesting that the function "complexABS(FFT_outputBuffer[i], FFT_outputBuffer[i+1])" returns 0. The input
to this function requires confirming. Also note that the value 2147483497 seems to be randomly generated by line 99 at times.

3. Screen scaling
Values of the Outarray require processing by an adequate scaling function to ensure that they are suitably displayed upon the LCD Screen.
At the moment the current scaling process appears to not only invert the displayed levels but also remain unchanged when the device is
subjected to vairious input signals though this may tie in with fault 2.

Bar height should be 0 when output array value is 0.
